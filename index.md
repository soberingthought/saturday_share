# Saturday Share Instructions

If you're here, you probably intend to submit a Saturday Share.  Thank you for volunteering!

[/u/soberingthought](https://www.reddit.com/user/soberingthought/) should have sent you the date of the next available Saturday for your share.

If you've forgotten or want a date, just [message him](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=soberingthought), or email him at [soberingthought2018@gmail.com](mailto:soberingthought2018@gmail.com)

### **Instructions**:

1. Please [post your share](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/submit?selftext=true) to /r/stopdrinking **any time after Friday 9pm Pacific (5am UTC)** or Saturday morning.  
    - The closer to Friday night, the more people will see it.
2. Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fstopdrinking) (not just /u/soberingthought) and they will appropriately flair/sticky your post
3. There is no step 3

### **Proposed Format**:

- Some background on your drinking
- Why you sought to get sober
- How your life has been in sobriety

Feel free to share whatever, and however much, of your story as you want.  Please keep in mind the [community guidelines](http://is.gd/sdfaq) for posts.

You might want to get an early start on your story.  When I went to type mine up, it took me twice as long as I expected and I had already expected it to take a long time ;-)

And, of course, if you have any questions, lemmeno!

Thanks,
