# Saturday Share Instructions

If you're here, you probably intend to submit a Saturday Share.  Thank you for volunteering!

[/u/soberingthought](https://www.reddit.com/user/soberingthought/) should have sent you the date of the next available Saturday for your share.

If you've forgotten or want a date, just [message him](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=soberingthought), or email him at [soberingthought2018@gmail.com](mailto:soberingthought2018@gmail.com)

### **Instructions**:

1. Please [post your share](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/submit?selftext=true) to /r/stopdrinking **any time on Friday**  
    - Yes, it's a Saturday Share, but allowing you to post anytime on Friday means that you can post when it's convenient for you.
    - Once your post is up, moderators will "sticky" the post (put it at the top of the subreddit) some time after 9pm Pacific (5am UTC) so it gets the most eyeballs
2. Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fstopdrinking) (not just /u/soberingthought) and they will appropriately flair/sticky your post after 9pm Pacific
    - Most people forget this step and I have to search for their post... :-(
3. There is no step 3

### **Proposed Format**:

- Some background on your drinking
- Why you sought to get sober
- How your life has been in sobriety

Feel free to share whatever, and however much, of your story as you want.  Please keep in mind the [community guidelines](http://is.gd/sdfaq) for posts.

You might want to get an early start on your story.  When I went to type mine up, it took me twice as long as I expected and I had already expected it to take a long time ;-)

And, of course, if you have any questions, let [/u/soberingthought](https://www.reddit.com/user/soberingthought/) know!

Thanks!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do I title the post?

Whatever you want, but having "Saturday Share" somewhere in there is helpful.

### Does a Moderator Need To Review It Before I Post It?

Nope.  We trust you.  That's one of the nice things about our community.  People are pretty responsible and courteous on their own.

No prob.  Just contact [/u/soberingthought](https://www.reddit.com/user/soberingthought/) and he'll put you back on the schedule at the next available Saturday.
